The player controls a character represented by a triangle at the bottom of the screen. Stars with calculus problems written on them fall from the top of the screen. The player's task is to move the character left or right to collect stars with correct answers while avoiding stars with incorrect answers. Each correct answer increases the player's score, while each incorrect answer reduces the player's lives. The game ends when the player loses all lives.
